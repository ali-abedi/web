Hi! This project is a home server for serving your personal files in your local network.

in this version also you can upload your files to your server

## Installation & Run:
First run this command on your home directory:

It will download the project on your computer.

You will have two options for serving your files: 

   1. Serving your main and normal files just using copy and paste your files in **~/web/base/static/base/ed** directory.
   2. Serving your movies and series in **~/web/base/static/base/ser** to create your custom directories for better organizing your files.

### Running the server:
